Project 3 is a Countdown timer that when started creates a timer that will count down. To start the timer enter the amound of seconds you want then press start. This will start the countdown and at the 5 second mark have a different color that shows it as a warning that you only have 5 seconds left. the program will automatically close after. This is the final version of the timer.
